GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
Chapter 1:  Introduction to Interactive Gaming System s 
 
1.1 Introduction  
 
1.1.1  General Statement  
 
Gaming Laboratories International, LLC (GLI)  has been testing gaming equipment since 1989. 
Over the years, GL I has developed numerous technical standards utilized by jurisdictions all over 
the world. This document, GLI -19, sets forth the technical standards for Interactive Gaming 
System s. 
 
1.1.2  Document History  
 
This document is a compilation based upon many standards documents from around the world. 
Some were written by GLI; others were written by industry regulators with input from independent 
test laboratories and Interactive Gaming System  operators, developers , and suppliers. GLI has taken 
each of the standards documents and merged the unique rules, eliminated some rules and updated 
others, to reflect both the change in technology and the purpose of maintaining an objective 
standard that achieves common regulat ory objectives without unnecessarily impeding 
technological innovation. GLI lists below, and gives credit to, agencies whose documents were 
reviewed prior to writing this Standard. It is the policy of GLI to update this document as often as 
warranted to re flect changes in technology  and/or  testing methods. This document will be 
distributed without charge and may be obtained by downloading it from the GLI website at 
www.gaminglabs.com  or by contacting GLI at:

1.2 Acknowledgment of Other Standards Reviewed  
 
1.2.1  General Statement  
 
This technical standard has been developed by reviewing and using portions of documents from the 
following organizations. GLI acknowledges and thanks the regulators and other industry 
participants who have assembled these documents:  
 
a) Nevada Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board.  
b) British Columbia Gaming Policy and En forcement Branch (GPEB).

g) Lottery and Gaming Authority, Malta.  
h) United Kingdom Gambling Commission.  
i) World Lottery Association (WLA).  
 
1.3 Purpose of Technical Standards  
 
1.3.1  General Statement  
 
The purpose of this technical standard is as follows:  
 
a) To eliminate subjective criteria in analyzing and certifying Interactive Gaming System s. 
b) To test the criteria that impact the credibility and integrity of Interactive Gaming System s from 
both the revenue collection and player’s perspective . 
c) To create a standard that will ensure interactive gaming is  fair, secure, and able to be audited 
and operated correctly.  
d) To distinguish between local public policy and Independent Test Laboratory criteria. It is up to 
each local jurisdiction to set its own public policy with respect to gaming . 
e) To recognize that the evaluation of internal control systems (such as Anti -Money Laundering, 
Financial and Business processes) employed by the operators of the Interactive Gaming System  
should not be incorporated into the laboratory  testing of th e standard but instead be included 
within the operational audit performed for  local jurisdictions.  
f) To construct a standard that  can be easily  revised  to allow  for new  technology. 
g) To construct a standard that does not specify any particular d esign, method, or algorithm . The 
intent is to allow a wide range of methods to be used to conform to the standards, while at the 
same time encourage new methods to be developed.  
 
1.3.2  No Limitation of Technology  
 
One should be cautioned that this document shall  not be read in such a way that limits the use of 
future technology. This document should not be interpreted to mean that if the technology is not 
mentioned, then it is not allowed. To the contrary, GLI will review this standard and make changes 
to incorporate minimum standards for any new and related technology.  
 
1.3.3  Adoption and Observance  
 
This technical standard can be adopted in whole or in part by any regulatory body that wishes to 
implement a comprehensive set of requirements for Interactive Gaming System s. 
 
1.4 Other Documents That May Apply  
 
1.4.1  Other GLI Standards

1.4.2  Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS)  
 
The implementation of an Interactive Gaming Sy stem  is a complex task, and as such will require the 
development of internal process es and procedures to ensure that the system is configured and 
operated with the necessary level of security and control. To that end, it is expected that a set of 
Minimum Internal Control Specifications (MICS) will be establish ed to define the internal processes 
for the management and  handling of games  as well as the requirements for internal c ontrol of any 
system or component software and hardware, and their associated accounts.  
 
1.5 Interpretation of this Document 
 
1.5.1  General Statement  
 
This technical standard applies to systems that support interactive gaming and  is intended to be  
general in nature and not limit or authorize specific game types and functionalities. The intent is to 
provide a framework to cover those currently known and permitted by law. This document is not 
intended to define which parties are responsible for meeti ng the requirements of this technical 
standard. It is the responsibility of the stakeholders of each operator to determine how to best meet 
the requirements laid out in this document.  
 
NOTE:  This technical standard does NOT apply to systems that support w agering on sports, competitions, 
matches, and other event types using an Event Wagering System . For detailed standards applicable to these 
systems, please reference the GLI -33 Standards for Event Wagering Systems . 
 
1.5.2  Software Suppliers and Operators  
 
The components of an Interactive Gaming System, although they may be constructed in a modular 
fashion, are designed to work seamlessly together. In addition, Interactive Gaming System s may be 
developed to have configurable features ; the final configuration of whi ch depend s on the options 
chosen by the operator. From a testing perspective, it might  not be possible to test all of the 
configurable features of an Interactive Gaming System  submitted by a software supplier in the 
absence of the final configuration chosen by the operator; however, the configuration that will be 
utilized in the production environment shall  be communicated to the independent test laboratory 
to facilitate  creati ng a functionally equivalent test environment. Because of the integrated nature of 
an Interactive Gaming System, there are several requirements in this document which may apply to 
both operators and suppliers. In these cases, where testing is requested for  a “white -label” version 
of the system, a specific configuration will be tested and reported.  
 
1.6 Testing and Auditing  
 
1.6.1  Laboratory Testing  
 
The independent test laboratory will test and certify the components of the Interactive Gaming 
System  in accordance with the chapters of this technical standard within a controlled test 
environment, as applicable. Any of these requirements which necessitate additional operational

GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
procedures to meet the intent of the requirement shall  be documented within the evaluation report 
and used to supplement the scope of the operational audit.  
 
1.6.2  Operational Audit  
 
The integrity and accuracy of the operation of an Interactive Gaming System  is highly dependent 
upon operational procedures, configurations, and the production environment ’s network 
infrastructure.  As such, an operational audit is an essential addition to the testing and certification 
of an Interactive Gaming System. The operational audit, outlined within the following appendices of 
this technical standard, shall  be perform ed at a frequency specified by the regulatory body : 
 
a) Appendix  A: Operational Audit of Gaming  Procedures  and Practices . This includes, but is not 
limited to, review of the internal controls , procedures and practices for gaming  operations, 
including, but not limited to establishing gaming  rules, managing  games, handling various 
gaming and financial transactions, creating and managing progressive jackpots , creating and 
managing jackpot s, player account  management, fundamental practices relevant to the 
limitation of risks, and any other objectives established by the regulatory body.  
b) Appendix B: Operational Audit of Technical Security Controls . This includes, but is not limited 
to, a  review of the operational processes that are critical to compliance, penetration testing 
focused on the external and internal infrastructure as well as the applications transferring, 
storing and/or processing of personally identifiable information (PII)  and/or other sensitive 
information, and any other objectives established by the regulatory body.  
c) Appendix C: Operational Audit of Service Providers . This includes the assessment of providers 
of particular services, which may be offered directly by the operator or involve the use of third -
party service providers, including, but not limited to evaluation of information security services, 
cloud services, payment services (financial institutions, payment processors, etc.), location 
services, live game services , and any other services which may be offered directly by the 
operator or involve the use of third -party service providers.

log in to the Interactive Gaming System fro m a specific Remote Player  Device. Allowable 
authentication credential s are subject to the discretion of the regulatory body as necessary. The 
requirement does not prohibit the option for more than one method of authentication being 
available for a player to access their account.  
 
a) If the system does not recognize the authentication credentials  when entered, an explanatory 
message shall be displayed to the player which prompts the player to try again. The error 
message shall be the same regardless of which authentication credential is incorrect.  
b) Where a player has forgotten their authentication credentials , a multi -factor authentication 
process shall be employed for the retrieval or reset of their forg otten authentication 
credentials . 
c) Current account balance information , including any incentive credits , and transaction options 
shall be available to the player once authenticated. All restricted incentive credits and incentive 
credits that have a possible expiration shall be indicated  separately . 
d) The system shall  support a mechanism that allows for an account to be locked in the event that 
suspicious activity is detected , such as  three consecutive failed access attempts in a thirty -
minute period . A multi- factor authentication process shall  be employed for the acco unt to be 
unlocked.  
 
NOTE:  Where passwords are used as an authentication credential, it is recommended that they are at least 
eight characters in length . 
 
2.5.4  Player Inactivity

Chapter 3:  Random Number Generator (RNG) Requirements  
 
3.1 Introduction   
 
3.1.1  General Statement  
 
This chapter sets forth the technical requirements for a Random Number Generator (RNG). The 
types of RNGs include the following : 
 
a) Software -based RNGs do not use hardware devices and derive their randomness principally and 
primarily from a computer -based or software -driven algorithm. They do not incorporate 
hardware randomness in a significant way.  
b) Hardware -based RNGs derive their ra ndomness from small -scale physical events (e.g., electric 
circuit feedback, thermal noise, radioactive decay, photon spin , etc .). 
c) Mechanical RNGs generate game outcomes mechanically, employing the laws of physics (e.g., 
wheels, tumblers, blowers, shufflers , etc .). 
 
NOTE : See also related requirements found in “ Game Outcome Using a Random Number Generator ” section 
as contained in the “ Game Requirements ” chapter of this standard.  
 
3.2 General RNG Requirements  
 
3.2.1  Source Code Review  
 
The independent test laboratory shall  review the source code pertaining to any and all core 
randomness algorithms, scaling algorithms, shuffling algorithms, and other algorithms or functions 
that play a critical role in the final random outcome selected for use by a game.  This review shall  
include comparison to published references, where applicable, and an examination for sources of 
bias, errors in implementation, malicious code, code with the potential to corrupt behavior, or 
undisclosed switches or parameters having a possible influence on randomness and fair play.  
 
3.2.2  Statistical Analysis  
 
The independent test laboratory shall  employ statistical tests to assess the outcomes produced by 
the RNG, after scaling, shuffling, or other mapping (hereafter referred to as “final outcome output”).  
The in dependent test laboratory shall  choose appropriate tests on a case -by-case basis, depending 
on the RNG under review and its usage within the game.  The tests shall  be selected to assure 
conformance to intended distribution of values, statistical independenc e between draws, and, if 
applicable, statistical independence between multiple values within a single draw.  The applied tests 
shall  be evaluated, collectively, at a 99% confidence level. The amount of data tested shall  be such 
that significant deviations f rom applicable RNG testing criteria can be detected with high frequency.  
In the case of an RNG intended for variable usage, it is the responsibility of the independent test 
laboratory to select and test a representative set of usages as test cases. Statistical tests may include 
any one or more of the following:  
 

 
 
 
Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  27 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
a) Total Distribution or Chi -square test;  
b) Overlaps test;  
c) Coupon Collector’s test;  
d) Runs test;  
e) Interplay Correlation test;  
f) Serial Correlation test; and  
g) Duplicates test.  
 
3.2.3  Distribution  
 
Each possible RNG selection shall  be equally likely to be chosen. Where the game design specifies a 
non- uniform distribution, the final outcome shall  conform to the intended distribution.  
 
a) All scaling, mapping, and shuffling algorithms used shall  be unbias ed, as verified by source code 
review. The discard of RNG values is permissible in this context and may be necessary to 
eliminate bias . 
b) The final outcome output shall  be tested against intended distribution using appropriate 
statistical tests (e.g., Total Distribution test).  
 
3.2.4  Independence  
 
Knowledge of the numbers chosen in one draw shall  not provide information on the numbers that 
may be chosen in a future draw. If the RNG selects multiple values within the context of a single 
draw, knowing one or more values shall  not provide information on the other values within the 
draw, unless provided for by the game design.  
 
a) As verified by source code review, the RNG shall  not discard or modify selections based on 
previous selections, except where intended by game de sign (e.g., without -replacement 
functionality) . 
b) The final outcome output shall  be tested for independence between draws and, as applicable, 
independence within a draw, using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., Serial or Interplay 
Correlation tests, and Ru ns test).  
 
3.2.5  Available Outcomes   
 
As verified by source code review, the set of possible outcomes produced by the RNG solution (i.e., 
the RNG period), taken as a whole, shall  be sufficiently large to ensure that all outcomes shall  be 
available on every draw with the appropriate likelihood, independent of previously produced  
outcomes, except where specified by the game design.   
 
3.3 RNG Strength and Monitoring  
 
3.3.1  RNG Strength for Outcome Determination  
 
The RNG used in the determination of game outcomes in a Gaming Platform shall be 
cryptographically strong. “Cryptographically stron g” means that the RNG is resistant to attack or 

 
 
 
Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  28 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
compromise by an intelligent attacker with modern computational resources, and who may have 
knowledge of the source code of the RNG.   
 
3.3.2  Cryptographic RNG Attacks  
 
A cryptographic RNG cannot be feasibly compromised by a skilled attacker with knowledge of the 
source code.  At a minimum, cryptographic RNGs shall be resistant to the following types of attack:  
 
a) Direct Cryptanalytic Attack:  Given a sequence of past values produced by the RNG, it shall be 
compu tationally infeasible to predict or estimate future RNG values.  This shall be ensured 
through the appropriate use of a recognized cryptographic algorithm (RNG algorithm, hash, 
cipher, etc.) . Note that a hardware -based RNG  or a m echanical RNGs may potentially qualify as a 
cryptographic algorithm, provided it passes statistical testing ;  
b) Known Input Attack:  It shall be infeasible to computationally determine or reasonably estimate 
the state of the RNG after initial seeding. In particular, the RNG shall not be seeded from a time 
value alone. The manufacturer shall ensure that games will not have the same initial seed.  
Seeding methods shall not compromise the cryptographic strength of the RNG; and  
c) State Compromise Extension Attack:  The RNG shall periodi cally modify its state, through the 
use of external entropy, limiting the effective duration of any potential exploit by a successful 
attacker.  
 
NOTE:  Because of continuous computational improvements and advances in cryptographic research, 
compliance to this criterion shall be re -evaluated as required by the regulatory body.  
 
3.3.3  Dynamic Output Monitoring  for Hardware -Based RNGs  
 
Due to their physical nature, the performance of hardware -based RNGs may deteriorate over time 
or otherwise malfunction, independent of the Gaming Platform. The failure of a hardware- based 
RNG could have serious consequences for the intended usage of the RNG.  For this reason, if a 
hardware -based RNG is used, there shall  be dynamic monitoring of the output by statistical test ing. 
This monitoring process shall  disable game play when malfunction or degradation is detected.  
 
3.4 Mechanical RNG (Physical Randomness Device)  
 
3.4.1  General Statement  
 
The requirements defined within this section apply to mechanical RNGs or “physical randomness  
devices” . While software  may be a part of the device , the  software  is primarily limited to operating 
machinery and/or  reading and recording game outcome data ( the software  does not play a 
deterministic role in determining  the game outcome) . 
 
NOTE:  Devices which faithfully and mechanically create or display a game outcome selected by a computer 
RNG are not considered physical randomness devices and shall be tested as RNGs on ce the faithful 
reproduction of RNG selected outcome has been assured.  Physical randomness devices may incorporate RNGs 
in secondary roles (e.g., rotation speed).  Such secondary RNGs need not be evaluated against the RNG 
requirements contained herein, as t hey do not directly select the game outcome.  Rather, the physical 

 
 
 
Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  29 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
randomness device shall be tested as a whole as described in this section.  
 
NOTE:  The approved components of a physical randomness devices cannot be swapped out or replaced with 
unapproved c omponents, as they are integral to the behavior and performance of the physical randomness 
devices . The “approved components” in this context include those physical items that produce the random 
behavior – e.g., balls in a mixer, cards in a shuffler, etc.  As one example, a shuffler certified by the independent 
test laboratory to utilize plastic cards cannot be viewed as an approved equivalent to the same mechanical 
shuffler using paper cards.  
 
3.4.2  Data Collection  
 
To provide best assurance of random behavior, the independent test laboratory shall  collect game 
outcome data for at least 10,000 game outcomes.  The data collection shall  be accomplished in a 
fashion reasonably similar to the intended use of the device in the field.  In particular, the 
recommended setup and calibration shall  be executed initially, and the device and components 
(cards, balls, etc.) shall  be replaced or servi ced during the collection period as recommended by the 
manufacturer.  
 
NOTE:  Due to feasibility concerns associated with reasonable data collection on some devices, the regulatory 
body may elect to accept testing results from a smaller collection amount on a case- by-case basis.  Equally 
possible, a larger data collection sample may be required.  Regardless, the independent test laboratory will 
clearly state in the applicable certification, the amount of data used for testing.  When less than 10,000 games 
are us ed, a statement on the statistical limitations of reduced testing will be clearly denoted within the 
certification report.  
 
3.4.3  Durability  
 
All mechanical pieces shall  be constructed of materials to prevent degradation of any component 
over its intended lifespan.  
 
NOTE:  The independent test laboratory may recommend a stricter replacement schedule than that suggested 
by the manufacturer of the device to comply with the ‘ Durability’ requirement stated above.  In addition, the 
independent test laboratory may recommend periodic inspection of the device to ensure and maintain its 
integrity.  
 
3.4.4  Tampering  
 
The player s and/or gaming attendant s (e.g., dealer s, croupier s, etc.) used in live games shall not 
have the ability to manipulate or influence the physical randomness devices in a physical manner 
with respect to the production of game outcome data, except as intended by game design.

player interface that affect game play and/or that impact the integrity or outcome of the game, 
except as provided for by the game rules . 
d) The display of the instructions and information shall  be adapted to the player interface. For 
example, where a device uses technologies with a smaller display screen, it is permissible to 
present an abridged version of the game information accessible directly from within the game 
screen and make available the full/complete version of the game information via another 
method, such as a secondary screen, help screen, or other interface that is easily identified on 
the visual game screen.  
e) Where multiple items of instructions and information are displayed on the player interface , it is 
acceptable to have this information displayed in an alternating fashion provided that, the rate at 
which information alternates permits a player a reasonable opportunity to read each item.

4.2.3  Simultane ous Inputs  
 
Simultaneous or sequential activation of various player interaction devices comprising a player 
interface shall  not cause game malfunctions and shall  not lead to results that are contrary to a 
game’s design intent.   
 
4.3 Gaming Session  Requirements  
 
4.3.1  General Statement   
 
A gaming session is defined as the period of time commencing, at minimum, when a player initiates 
a game or series of games on a Gaming Platform for a particular game theme by committing a wager 
and ending at the time of a final game outcome for that game or series of games and coincident with 
the opportunity for the player to exit the game.   
 
NOTE : This standard is not intended to preclude or prohibit designs that allow the simultaneous play of 
multiple games themes on a Gaming Platform. Where multiple game themes are accessible simultaneously, 
players may play more than one game at a time in separate gaming sessions. However, in su ch a case, 
metering and applicable limits shall be enforced against each available game, as it is played, and all other 
requirements within this chapter shall continue to apply to these multiple game -in-play designs. 
 
4.3.2  Selection of Game   
 
The following requ irements apply to the selection of a specific game on the player interface : 
 
a) The Gaming Platform shall clearly inform the player of all games available for play . 
b) The player shall be made aware of which game theme has been selected for play and is being 
played . 
c) The player shall not be forced to play a game just by selecting a game theme, unless the game 
screen clearly indicates the game selection is unchangeable.  If not disclosed, the player shall be 
able to return to the main menu or game chooser s creen prior to committing a wager . 
d) The default game display upon entering game play mode from a main menu or game chooser 
screen, shall not correspond to the highest advertised award (unless that was the outcome of 
the player’s last game play). This applie s to the primary game only and not to any secondary 
bonuses/features.  
 
4.3.3  Game  Play Requirements  
 
The following requirements apply to game play within a gaming session:  
 
a) A game cycle consists of all player actions and game play  activity that occur from wager to 
wager.  Game cycle initiation shall occur after the player : 
i. Places a wager or commits a bet; and/or  
ii. Presses a "play" button or performs a similar action to initiate a game in accordance with 
the rules  of the game.  
b) Amounts wagered or committed at any point at the start of, or within the course of a game cycle

the second part of a two -part keno game); and  
v. Double -up/gamble features.  
d) A game cycle shall be considered complete when all funds  wagered are lost or when the final 
transfer to the player’s credit meter or player account balance  takes place. The value of every 
award  at the end of a game cycle is added to the player’s credit meter or player account balance, 
except for merchandise  and large payouts where required by the regulatory body . 
e) It shall not be possible to start a new game within the same gaming session before the current 
game cycle is completed and the funds available for wagering and the game history have been 
updated, including the game elements listed above, unless the action to start a new game 
terminates the current game in an orderly manner. Some exceptio ns may be granted in 
instances where, for example, if the operator elects to conduct offline, manual consideration of 
large payouts, or if a player chooses to continue gaming while a large payout is pending.  
 
4.3.4  Information to be Displayed  
 
A player interface shall display the following information within a gaming session, with the 
exception of when the player is viewing an informational screen such as a menu or help screen:

otherwise derive these parameters;  
d) Any player wager options that occur prior to game initiation, or during the course of game play;  
e) For the last completed game, the following information until the next game starts, wager 
options are modified, or the player exits the game;  
i. Accurate representation of the game outcome;  
ii. Amount won; and  
iii. Any player wager options in effect.  
 
NOTE:  It is acceptable for the information for the last completed game to be cleared before the above -
mentioned conditions occur as long as the same information is clearly available to the player under the “ Game 
Recal l” section of this document.  
 
4.3.5  Credit Meter  
 
Depending on the implementation within the Gaming Platform, funds may be transferred from the 
player account balance to a credit meter  for the gaming session. This may be automatic where the 
player account balan ce is automatically transferred to the credit meter or the Gaming Platform 
present s transfer options to the player, which require selection before occurring.  Such options 

 
 
 
Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  33 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
would include how much the player wishes to transfer to the session’s credit meter.  Once play is 
complete the player shall have the option to transfer some or all of their funds back to their player 
account balance.  Exiting a gaming session shall cause all funds to be automatically transferred back 
to their player account balance. Additio nally, the credit meter, shall conform to the following 
requirements when in use:  
 
a) The credit meter shall be visible to the player at any time a wager may be placed, at any time a 
transfer to  or from the player account balance is allowed, or at any time th e meter is actively 
being incremented or decremented.  
b) The credit meter shall be displayed in credits or local currency format . If the game’s credit 
meter allows for toggling between credits and currency, this functionality shall be easily 
understood by the  player . The credit meter shall clearly indicate whether credits or currency 
are currently being displayed . 
c) If the current local currency amount is not an even multiple of the denomination for a game, or 
the credit amount has a fractional value, the credit s displayed for that game may be displayed 
and played as a truncated amount, (i.e., fractional part removed). However, the fractional credit 
amount shall be made available to the player when the truncated credit balance is zero.  
d) If restricted incentive credits and unrestricted player funds are combined  on one credit meter, 
restricted credits shall be wagered first, as allowed by the rules of the game, before any 
unrestricted player funds are wagered.  
 
4.4 Game Information and Rules of Play  
 
4.4.1  Game Information and Rules of Play

rules of play shall  be complete and unambiguous and shall  not be misleading or unfair to the 
player.   
b) Help screen information shall be accessible by a player without the need for funds deposited or 
commitment of a wager.  This information shall include descriptions of unique game 
bonuses/features, extended play, free spins, double- up, autoplay, countdown timers, symbol 
transformat ions, community bonuses, progressive jackpots, incrementing jackpots, etc.).  
c) Minimum, maximum, and other available wagers shall  be stated within, or be able to be 
deduced from, the artwork, with adequate instruction for any available wager option.  
d) Paytabl e information shall  include all possible winning outcomes and combinations, along with 
their corresponding payouts, for any available modifiers and /or wager options.  
e) The artwork shall  clearly indicate whether awards are designated in credits, currency, or some 
other unit.  
f) For artwork that contains game instructions explicitly advertising a credit award or 
merchandise prize, it shall be possible to win the advertised award/prize from a single game, or 
series of games enabled by an initiating game, when including bonuses/features , or other game 
options, or the artwork shall clearly specify the criteria necessary to win the advertised

GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
award/prize .  
g) The game shall  reflect any change in awa rd value, which may occur during the course of play.  
This may be accomplished with a digital display in a conspicuous location of the player 
interface. The game shall  clearly state the criteria for which any award  value is modified.   
h) Game instructions that  are presented aurally shall  also be presented in written form within the 
artwork.  
i) Game instructions shall  be rendered in a color that contrasts with the background color to 
ensure that all instructions are clearly visible/readable. 
j) The artwork shall  clear ly state the rules for payments of awards . If a specific winning 
combination is paid where multiple wins are possible, then the payment method shall  be 
described.  
i. The artwork shall  clearly communicate the treatment of coinciding game outcomes.  For 
example, whether or not a straight flush is construed as both a flush and a straight, or if 
3/4/5 of a kind can be construed as paying all of kind or just the highest.  Where a payline 
may be interpreted to have more than one such winning combination, there shall  be a 
statement if only the highest winning combination is paid per line . 
ii. Where the same symbol can qualify for a line pay and scatter pay simultaneously or where 
line and scatter pays occur simultaneously on the same line, the artwork shall  indicate if the 
player will be paid for both wins, or the greater of the two . 
iii. The artwork shall  clearly communicate the treatment of coinciding scattered wins with 
respect to other possible scatte red wins.  For example, the artwork shall  state whether 
combinations of scattered symbols pay all possible awards  or only the highest award . 
k) Where multiplier instructions are displayed in artwork, it shall  be clear what the multiplier 
does and does not apply to.  
l) All game symbols/objects shall  be clearly displayed to the player and shall  not be misleading.  
i. Game instructions that specifically co rrespond to one or more symbols/ awards , shall  be 
clearly associated with those symbols/ awards . For example, this may be achieved with 
appropriate framing or boxing.  Additional wording such as “these symbols” may also be 
used.  
ii. If game instructions refer to a particular symbol, and the written name for the symbol may 
be mistaken for another symbol, or may imply other characteristics, then the visual display 
of the instructions shall  clearly indicate to which symbol the instruction refers.   
iii. Game symbols and ob jects shall  retain their shape throughout all artwork, except while 
animation is in progress.  Any symbol that changes shape or color during an animation 
process shall  not appear in a way that can be misinterpreted to be some other symbol 
defined in the pay table. 
iv. If the function of a symbol changes (e.g., a non -substitute symbol becomes a substitute 
symbol during a feature), or the symbol’s appearance changes, the artwork shall  clearly 
indicate this change of function or appearance and any special conditions  that apply to it.  
v. If limitations exist with respect to the location and/or appearance of any symbol, the 
limitation shall  be disclosed in the artwork.  For example, if a symbol is only available in a 
bonus game, or on a specific reel strip, then the artwor k shall  disclose this.  
m) The artwork shall  clearly state which symbols/objects may act as a substitute or wild, and in 
which winning combinations the substitute or wild may be applied; this description shall  
address any/all phases of game play where a wild o r substitute symbol operates.

winning combinations the scatter may be applied.  
o) The artwork shall  contain textual and/or graphical information to clearly explain the ord er in 
which symbols are to appear, in order for a n award to be issue d or a feature to be triggered, 
including numbers to indicate how many correct symbols/objects each pattern corresponds to.  
p) The game shall  not advertise ‘upcoming wins’, for example, “thre e times pay coming soon”, 
unless the advertisement is accurate and mathematically demonstrable, or unless the player has 
a direct advertisement of the current progress to that win (e.g., they have two of four  tokens 
collected that are required to win a n aw ard). 
q) The game artwork shall  clearly explain to the player any non- wager purchase option and its 
value in credits or local currency.  
r) The artwork shall  disclose any restrictive features of game play, such as any play duration 
limits, maximum win values, etc. which are implemented as an element of game design.  
s) There shall be sufficient information regarding any award payout adjustments such as a rake, 
commission, or fee taken by the operator , as applicable.  
 
4.4.2  Multi -Wager Game s 
 
The following requirements shall apply, as relevant to the specific game design, to games where 
multiple, independent wagers can simultaneously be applied towards advertised awards:  
 
a) Each individual wager placed shall be clearly indicated so that the player is in no doubt as to 
which wagers have been made and the credits bet per wager;  
b) The winning amount for each separate wager, and total winning amount, shall be displayed on 
the game screen; and  
c) Each winning award obtained shall be displayed to the player in a way that clearly associates 
the award to the appropriate wager. Where there are wins associated with multiple wagers, 
each winning wager may be indicated in turn.  In cases where there is a multitude of wager 
information to convey, a summary screen may  suffice.  Any exceptions will be reviewed by the 
independent test laboratory on a case -by-case basis.  
 
4.4.3  Line Game s

only, or as scatter pays);  and 
f) Winning paylines shall be clearly discernible to the player . Where there are wins on multiple 
lines, each winning payline shall be indicated in turn.  This requirement shall not preclude other 
intuitive methods of displaying line wins such as the grouping of common win types, nor shall it 
prohibit a player option to bypass a detailed outcome display of line wins, where supported.

Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  39 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
player do not affect the outcome(s) of any other player, unless otherwise denoted by the game 
rules; and  
b) There shall be a method  provided by a multi -player game for each player to know when the 
next game will begin.  
 
NOTE:  Please reference the “ Peer -to-Peer (P2P) Gaming Sessions” section of this chapter for specific and 
supplemental requ irements for multi- player games where players compete against  one another.  
 
4.5 Game Outcome Using a Random Number Generator (RNG)  
 
4.5.1  RNG and Evaluation of Game Outcome  
 
The evaluation of game outcome using an RNG shall comply with the following rules:  
 
a) Where more than one RNG is used to determine different game outcomes, each RNG shall be 
separately evaluated; and  
b) Where each instance of an RNG is identical, but involves a different implementation within the 
game, each implementation shall be separately evaluated.  
 
4.5.2  Game Selection Process  
 
Determination of events of chance that result in a monetary award shall not be influenced, affected, 
or controlled by anything other than the values selected by an approved RNG, in accordance with 
the following requiremen ts: 
 
a) When making calls to the RNG, the game shall not limit the outcomes available for selection, 
except as provided for by game design;  
b) The game shall not modify or discard outcomes selected by the RNG due to adaptive behavior.  
Additionally, outcomes sha ll be used as directed by the rules of the game;  
c) After selection of the game outcome, the game shall not display a “near miss” where it makes a 
variable secondary decision which affects the result shown to the player. For example, if the 
RNG chooses a losi ng outcome, the game shall not substitute a different losing outcome to show 
to the player than that originally selected ; 
d) Except as provided for by the rules of the game, events of chance shall be independent and shall 
not correlate with any other events within the same game, or events within previous games:  
i. A game shall not adjust the likelihood of a bonus/feature occurring, based on the history of 
awards obtained in previous games;  
ii. A game shall not adapt its theoretical return to the player based  on past payouts;  
e) Any associated equipment used in conjunction with a Gaming Platform shall not influence or 
modify the behaviors of the game’s RNG and/or random selection process, except as authorized, 
or intended by design; and  
f) Events of chance shall no t be affected by the effective bandwidth, link utilization, bit error rate 
or other characteristic of the communications channel between the Gaming Platform and the 
Remote Player Device. The player shall be informed where these characteristics may have, or  
appear to have, any other effect on the game, such as in decision making where speed is a factor, 
the update of the  jackpot  display s, or disconnection from multi- player games.

GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
 
4.6 Game Fairness  
 
4.6.1  Game Fairness  
 
The following requirements shall  apply to the fairness of the game:  
 
a) Games that are designed to give a player the perception that they have control over the 
outcome of the game due to skill or dexterity, when they actually do not (i.e., the game outcome 
is random, and the illusion of skill is for entertainment value only), shall  fully disclose this fact 
within the game help screens. This does not apply to games that have no basis for skill and/or 
where no strategy applies. An example would be a simple pick -a-bonus game, where it is 
obvious to the player that the outcome is chance- based ; 
b) Games shall  not include any hidden source code that can be leveraged by a player to circumvent 
the rules of play and/or the intended behaviors of game design; this requirement shall  not 
preclude reasonably identifiable “discovery features” offered by a game which are  intentional 
from a design perspective, but which may be undocumented or unknown to the player; and  
c) The final outcome of each game shall  be displayed for a sufficient length of time that permits a 
player a reasonable opportunity to verify the outcome of th e game; this requirement shall  not 
preclude an option for the player to bypass the outcome display.  
 
4.6.2  Simulation of Physical Objects  
 
Where a game incorporates a graphical representation or simulation of a physical object that is 
used to determine game outc ome, the behaviors portrayed by the simulation shall  be consistent 
with the real -world object, unless otherwise denoted by the game artwork . This requirement does  
not apply to graphical representations or simulations that are utilized for entertainment pur poses 
only.  The following shall  apply to the simulation:  
 
a) The probability of any event occurring in the simulation that affects the outcome of the game 
shall  be analogous to the properties of the physical object , unless otherwise disclosed to the 
player ;  
b) Where the game simulates multiple physical objects that would normally be expected to be 
independent of one another based on the rules of the game, each simulation shall  be 
independent of any other simulations; and  
c) Where the game simulates physical objects  that have no memory of previous events, the 
behavior of the simulated objects shall  be independent of their previous behavior, so as to be 
non- adaptive and non -predictable, unless otherwise disclosed to the player.  
 
4.6.3  Physics Engine  
 
Games may utilize a “physics engine” which is specialized software that approximates or simulates 
a physical environment, including behaviors such as motion, gravity, speed, acceleration, inertia, 
trajectory, etc. A physics engine shall  be designed to main tain consistent play behaviors and game 
play environment unless an indication is otherwise provided to the player by the game artwork. A 
physics engine may utilize the random properties of an RNG to impact game outcome, in which 

 
 
 
Copyright  2020 Gaming Laboratories International, LLC  All Rights Reserved.  
  41 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
case, the “ Random Number Generator (RNG) Requirements ” shall  apply .  
 
NOTE:  Implementations of a physics engine in a game will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis by the 
independent test laboratory.  
 
4.6.4  Live Game Correlation  
 
Unless otherwis e denoted in the game artwork, where the Gaming Platform offers a game that is 
recognizable as a simulation of a live casino game such as poker, blackjack, roulette, etc., the same 
probabilities associated with the live game shall  be evident in the simulat ed game.  For example, the 
odds of getting any particular number in roulette where there is a single zero (0) and a double zero 
(00) on the wheel, shall  be 1 in 38; the odds of drawing a specific card or cards in poker shall  be the 
same as in the live game.   
 
4.6.5  Random Event Probability  
 
For games that incorporate a random event or an element of chance that affects the outcome, the 
mathematical probability of any chance event occurring for a paid game shall  be constant, unless 
otherwise denoted by the game artwork.  
 
4.7 Game Payout Percentages , Odds, and Non -Cash Awards  
 
4.7.1  Software Requirements for Percentage Payout  
 
Each house -banked game shall theoretically payout a minimum of seventy -five percent (75%) 
during the expected lifetime of the game unless otherwise specified by the regulatory body . 
Progressive  jackpots,  incrementing jackpot s, incentive  award s, merchandise, etc. shall not be 
included in the percentage payout if they are external to the game, unless required for operation.   
 
a) The minimum percentage requirement shall  be met for all wagering configurations.  If a game is 
continuously played at any single bet level, line configuration, etc. for the life of the game, the 
minimum percentage requirement shall  be satisfied.  
b) Games that may be affected by player skill shall  meet the minimum percentage requirement  
when using an optimal method of play that provides the greatest return to the player over a 
period of continuous play.  
c) For progressive jackpots and incrementing jackpot s used in  the return to player (RTP) 
calculations for the game, the minimum percentage requirement shall be met using the lowest 
available parameters for the jackpot during the expected lifetime of the game. 
d) Where allowed by the regulatory body  for games in which the above minimum percentage 
requirements are not met ( e.g., electronic scratch ticket games or lottery games), the minimum 
RTP of the game shall be displayed to the player and shall meet the “Return to Player (RTP) 
Display” requirements.  
 
NOTE:  At the discretion of the regulatory body, the independent test laboratory can apply an alternative 
approach to return percentage calculations.

GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
4.7.2  Return to Player (RTP) Display  
 
At its discretion, a regulatory body may elect to require the artwork to contain the RTP for each 
house -banked game. If the RTP is displayed, the following requirements shall be met:   
 
a) The artwork shall  fully explain how the displayed  RTP was determined (i.e., minimum, 
maximum, average, etc.) and thus how the player may realize it (i.e., wager requirements).  
b) For games that may be affected by player skill, the displayed RTP shall be based on a strategy 
specifically advertised in the game rules or an optimal  strategy that is derivable from the game 
rules.  
c) For games that offer progressive jackpots or incrementing jackpots, limited time awards, or 
other bonuses/features , the variable contribution of such awards to the displayed RTP shall be 
clearly disclosed . 
d) For games that offer bonus/feature game s which require extra credits to be wagered , the 
displayed RTP shall  consider that an additional wager  was  placed  unless otherwise advertised .  
e) If the displayed RTP represents  the actual RTP, the number of game plays associated with that 
calculation shall  be advertised  along with the period with which the game plays took place.  
 
4.7.3  Odds  
 
The odds of achieving the highest advertised award that is based solely upon chance shall occur at 
least once in one hundred million (100 ,000,000 ) games, unless the game artwork prominently 
displays the actual odds of that award to the player. This does not apply to multiple awards won 
together on the same game where the aggregate prize is not advertised. This odds rule  shall not 
apply to games which make it possible for a player to win the highest advertised award multiple 
times through the use of a bonus/feature. This rule shall apply to all wager categories that can win 
the highest advertised award. If the highest adv ertised award can occur within a bonus/feature, the 
odds calculation shall include the odds of obtaining the bonus/feature including the odds to achieve 
the award.  This rule does not apply towards incentive awards.  
 
4.7.4  Limitations on Awards  
 
Limitations on the award amounts in lieu of merchandise, annuities, or payment plans shall be 
clearly explained to the player on the game theme that is offering such a prize.  
 
4.8 Bonus/Feature Requirements  
 
4.8.1  Bonus/Feature Games  
 
Games which offer a b onus/feature shall  meet the following requirements:  
 
a) A game which offers a bonus/feature, other than those that occur randomly, shall  display to the 
player sufficient information to indicate the current status towards the triggering of the next 
bonus/feat ure;  
b) If a game requires obtaining several achievements towards the activation of a bonus/feature , or 
the issuance  of an award , the number of achievements needed to trigger the bonus/feature , or

  43 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
win the award , shall  be indicated, along with the number colle cted at any point;  
c) The game shall  make it clear to the player that they are in a bonus/ feature mode;  
d) If a game offers a bonus/feature which allows the player to hold one or more 
reels/cards/symbols for the purpose of a re -spin or draw, then the held reels /cards/symbols 
shall  be clearly indicated and the method for changing holds shall  be clearly explained to the 
player;  
e) If a bonus/feature is triggered after accruing a certain number of events/symbols or 
combination of events/symbols of a different kind ove r multiple games, the probability of 
obtaining like events/symbols shall  not deteriorate as the bonus/feature progresses, unless 
otherwise disclosed to the player; and  
f) If a bonus/feature consists of multiple events or spins, then a counter shall  be maintai ned and 
displayed to the player to indicate the number of spins initially awarded and the number of 
spins remaining during bonus/feature play, or alternatively, the number of spins that have been 
played.  
 
4.8.2  Player Selection or Interaction in a Bonus/Feature  
 
Games which offer a bonus/feature which requires player selection or interaction are prohibited 
from automatically making selections or initiating the bonus/feature , unless the game meets one of 
the requirements listed below and explains the mechanism for automatic initiation or selection in 
the artwork:  
 
a) The player is presented with a choice and specifically acknowledges their intent to have the 
game auto -initiate the bonus/feature by means of a button press or another player interaction;  
b) The bonus/feature provides only one choice to the player, i.e., press button to spin wheel. In 
this case, the bonus/feature may auto -initiate after a time out period of at least two minutes;  or 
c) The bonus/feature is offered as part of a community bonus that involves two or more players 
and where the delay of an offered selection or game initiation will directly impact the ability for 
other players to continue their bonus/ feature. Prior to automatically making selections or 
initiating a community bonus the playe r shall  be made aware of the time remaining in which 
they shall  make their selection or initiate play.  
 
4.8.3  Extra Credits Wagered During a Bonus/Feature  
 
If a bonus/feature in progress requires extra funds to be wagered in order to continue, the player 
shall be provided an opportunity not to participate. If all winnings from the game in progress are 
accumulated to a temporary “win” meter, rather than directly to the credit meter  or player account 
balance , the game shall:  
 
a) Provide a means where winnings on the temporary  “win” meter can be wagered (i.e., add funds 
to the credit meter or player account balance) to allow for instances where the player has an 
insufficient amount of funds available  to complete the bonus/feature, or allow the player to add 
fund s to the credit meter  or player account balance ; and  
b) Transfer all funds  on the temporary “win” meter to the credit meter or player account balance 
upon completion of the bonus/feature.

Community bonus es, where players collaborate and/or compete for a shared award , shall : 
  
a) Contain an appropriate description of the rules governing each community bonus, each payout 
and any conditions regarding player eligibility for the community bonus award(s) ; 
b) Continuous ly and conspicuously display the player’s  eligibility for a community bonus, 
regardless of the number of credits on the game.  For example, if the player has thirty  seconds of 
eligibility time remaining but has run out of credits, the game will continue to display and count 
down the seconds remaining ; and  
c) For community bonus es not dependent on the number of credits available, alert the player of 
their continued eligibility regardless of whether the player has credits remaining on the game.  
 
4.8.5  Double -Up/Gamble Features   
 
The following requirements apply to games which  offer some form of a double -up/gamble feature.  
Such games may use alternative terminology such as “Triple -Up” or “Take -or-Risk” to describe a 
double -up/gamble feature : 
 
a) All double -up/gamble feature instructions shall  be fully disclosed in the game's artwork and 
shall  be accessible without committing to the feature;  
b) Entry to a double -up/gamble feature shall  only occur upon completion of a winning primary 
game;  
c) The player shall have a choice as to whether or not they want to participate in the double -
up/gamble feature;  
d) The double -up/gamble feature shall  have a theoretical return to the player of one hundred 
percent (100%);   
e) The maximum number of double -ups/gambles available shall  be clearly stated, or as a suitable 
alternative, the award  limit for double -up/gamble shall  be disclosed to the player;  
f) Only c redits won on the primary game shall be available for wagering on a double -up/gamble 
feature (i.e., it is not possible to wager any funds from the credit meter or player account 
balance on double -up/gamble);  
g) When the double -up/gamble feature is discontinue d automatically before reaching the 
maximum number of double -ups/gambles available, the reason shall  be clearly stated;  
h) Any game conditions during which the double -up/gamble feature is not available shall  be 
specified;  
i) If a double -up/gamble feature offers a choice of multipliers, it shall  be clear to the player what 
the range of choices and payouts are; and  
j) If the player selects a multiplier for a double -up/gamble  feature, it shall  be clearly stated on the 
screen which multiplier has been selected.  
 
4.8.6  Mystery Award Features  
 
A mystery award is an award paid by a game that is not associated with a specific paytable 
combination. It is acceptable for games to offer a mystery award; however, the game artwork shall 
indicate the minimum and maximum amounts that the player could potentially win.  If the minimum

  45 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
amount that could potentially be awarded is zero, then it is not required to be explicitly displayed. If 
the value of the mystery award  depends on credits wagered, or any other factors, the conditions 
shall be c learly stated.  
 
4.9 Alternative Game Modes  
 
4.9.1  Free Play Mode  
 
Free play mode allows a player to participate in a game without placing a wager. If the game 
supports a free play mode of operation, the following requirements apply:  
 
a) Free play games shall  accurately represent the normal operation of a paid game. Games played 
in free play mode shall  not mislead the player about the likelihood of winning any award s 
available in the wagered version of the game;  
b) Free play mode shall  be pro minently displayed so a player knows at all times if/when this mode 
is active;  
c) Free play mode shall  not increment the credit meter or the player account balance. Specific 
meters are permissible for this mode provided the meters clearly indicate as such;  
d) Free play mode shall  be terminated whenever the player opts to exit this mode, or when the 
free play game(s) are concluded; and  
e) When free play mode is exited, the game shall  return to its previous state.  
 
NOTE:  Paid games which may be played with credits rec eived from an incentive award are not considered 
free play games.  
 
4.9.2  Autoplay Mode   
 
Autoplay mode allows a game to place wagers automatically without player interaction, once a 
denomination, wager, and other play attributes have been selected by the player.  If the game 
supports an autoplay mode, the following rules apply:  
 
a) Autoplay mode shall  be securely controlled using a function that either allows or disallows the 
feature, reflective of jurisdictional preference;  
b) Autoplay mode may allow the player to choo se the individual game wager, the number of 
autoplay wagers, and/or the total amount to be wagered;   
i. All player -defined thresholds shall  remain in effect for the duration of autoplay;  
ii. The game shall  display the number of autoplay wagers remaining or the nu mber used, 
reflective of a player -defined threshold;  
iii. Autoplay mode shall  end automatically and return to manual game play when player -
defined thresholds are reached;  
c) Autoplay mode shall  offer the player an option to terminate autoplay mode at the completi on of 
a current game, regardless of how many autoplay wagers they initially chose or how many 
remain; and  
d) If player options are supported for autoplay mode, these options shall  default to the manual 
mode of game play.

4.9.3  Tournament Mode  
 
Tournament mode allows a player to engage in competitive play against other players in an 
organized, measured event.  Play during t ournament mode  may be in- revenue or out -of-revenue. If 
the game supports a specific tournament mode, which is separate from regular game play,  the 
following requirements apply:  
 
a) All of the rules within the “ Contests/Tournaments ” section of this document shall be disclosed  
to the player;

4.10 Games with Skill  
 
4.10.1  General Statement  
 
A game with skill contains one or more elements in its design which can be leveraged by a player to 
impact the return percentage. Skill means the human attributes of a player such as knowledge, 
dexterity, visual recognition, logic, memory, reaction, strength, agility, athleticism, hand -to-eye 
coordination, numerical and/or lexical ability, or any other ability or expertise relevant to game 
play.   The requirements defined within this se ction shall apply to games with skill to ensure player 
fairness and clarity with respect to player notification.  
 
NOTE:  This technical standard is not intended to classify a game as a “skill game” or to serve as a legal basis 
for game classification within the context of skill.  Such classifications will be subject to interpretation by the 
regulatory body.

GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
A game with skill shall  conform to the applicable display requirements found in related sections of 
this standard for “ Game Information and Rules of Play ”, “Information to be Displayed ”, and “ Game 
Fairness ”. In addition, a ny game with skill other than traditional casino games (e.g., poker, 
blackjack, etc.) shall  prominently disclose that the outcome is affected by player skill.  This 
disclosure shall  be prominently displayed on the game  prior to committing a wager.  
 
4.10.3  Virtual  Opponent

b) Prevents the virtual opponent from uti lizing privileged information of the live player upon 
which a decision is made, unless otherwise disclosed to the player.  
 
4.10.4  Outcome for Games with Skill  
 
Except as otherwise disclosed to the player, once a game with skill is initiated, no function of the 
game related to game outcome shall  be altered during play.  Additionally, in the event that available 
paytables or rules of play change between games, notice of the change shall  be prominently 
displayed to the player through the game artwork and shall  provide  adequate information so  a 
player can make an informed decision. An example of the latter case might be the use of an 
identifier to change the paytables available to the player during the course of play.  
 
4.10.5  Odds for Skill -Based Awards  
 
If the highest  advertised award is a skill -based award , it shall be available to be achieved by a

award shall meet the “ Odds ” requirement specified earlier in this chapter.  
 
4.10.6  Player Advice Features   
 
A game with skill may support a feature that offers advice, hints, or suggestions to a player. An 
illustrative example might be a trivia game that provides hints, clues, or other player assistance in 
making a selection.  A game with skill may support player advice features provided that it conforms 
to the following requirements:  
 
a) The player advice feature shall  clearly describe to the player that it is available and what 
options exist for selection;  
b) Any player advice that is offered to the player for purchase shall  clearly disclose the cost and

skill, then the game with skill shall  provide adequate and clear instruction on their purpose, usage, 
and effect. If there are multiple player interaction devices able to affect the same player action  
involving skill , then all such options shall be clearly explained to the player.  
 
4.11 Peer -to-Peer (P2P) Gam ing  
 
4.11.1  P2P Gaming Sessions  
 
Peer -to-Peer (P2P) gaming sessions  are environments which offer players the opportunity to play 
with and against each other. In these environments, the operator usually does not engage in the 
P2P gaming session as a party ( e.g., house -banked  gaming), but usually provides the environment 
for use by its players, and may take a rake, commission, or  fee for the service. The following 
requirements apply:  
 
a) Players shall  be prevented from occupying more than one position in any P2P  gaming session 
unless authorized by the rules of the game ;

into the next game.  Non -game sensitive actions, such as accessing the help menu do not require 
this status to be removed.  
e) If a pla yer has been in “Away from Play” status for more than a period of time disclosed to the 
player, the player shall  be automatically removed from the P2P gaming session they are 
currently enrolled in.  
 
4.12 Persistence Games  
 
4.12.1  General Statement  
 
A persistence game is associated with a unique attribute (e.g., player ID, game theme/pa ytable  ID, 
etc.) and incorporates a feature that enables progress towards the award of game play 
enhancements and/or bonuses through the achievement of some designated game outcome. These 
additional offerings become available when the player has achieved specific thresholds defined for 
game play. Each designated outcome advances the state of the persistence game.  Multiple plays of a 
game are usually necessary to trigger the persistence award.  
 
4.12.2  Persistence Game Thresholds  
 
A persistence game shall  recognize a particular attribute for the purpose of restoring previously 
earned  thresholds during each subsequent visit to a game.  A persistence game  shall  contain in its

  50 
 
GLI-19 – Standards for Interactive Gaming Systems  Version 3.0  
or additional elements are added to the gam e, as play continues. Additionally, play from save allows 
the player to save a persistence game at critical points (i.e., save points), typically after some 
accomplishment or goal has been achieved. The player can resume game play from that point at a 
later date and continue on to the next goal. The following requirements apply to play from save:  
 
a) Awards  issued  or made available for reaching a save point shall  be clearly defined and 
displayed to the player prior to placing any wager.  If a random type award may be won, the 
details and all possible payouts shall  be displayed to the player;  
b) The game shall  provide a suitable notification to the player whenever a designated save point is 
reached during play;  
c) If game rules or awards change as different levels are reached during play from save activity, 
these changes shall  be clearly displayed to the player; and  
d) If the play from save state is not indefinitely maintained, then the game shall  provide an 
indication to the player of any limitation and/or expiration of s aved data that is stored for use 
in supporting game play at a later period in time.

NOTE:  This section does not apply to awards of restrictive incentive credits , bonuses/features which offer 
awards which may increase over a single game cycle or, static awards whose probabilities of triggering 
change as the game is played. This section also does not apply to persistence game features which increase as 
the game is played (e.g., number of free games, multipliers, several achievements towards the activation of a 
bonus/feature or the issuance of an award, etc.) or “levels” of static awards available to be won based on 
player experience and/or achievements.  
 
4.13.2  Jackpot Display  
 
The jackpot display is used to indicate the current  jackpot award amount or " payoff " for each 
jackpot in credits or the local currency format to all players who are playing a game which may 
potentially trigger the jackpot . If the jackpot offers a “mystery payoff” where the actual payoff is not 
displayed to the player, the “ Mystery Award  Features ” shall apply.   
 
a) As games are played, the current payoff  for each jackpot shall be updated on the jackpot display 
at least every thirty seconds from the incrementing game event to reasonably reflect the actual 
size of the payoff. The use of odometer and other “paced” updating displays are allowed .

Where allowed by the regulatory body , a Jackpot Diversion Scheme may be used , where a portion of 
the jackpot contributions are diverted to another pool or “diversion pool” to be used as needed by 
the design of the jackpot  (e.g., the diversion pool may be added to the reset value of the next jackpot 
or be used to pay simultaneous w ins of a jackpot) .  
 
a) A Jackpot Diversion Scheme shall be able to be implemented such that it does not have a 
mathematical expectation of infinity.  
b) Diversion pools shall not be truncated. Diverted contributions once that diversion pool has

iii. The jackpot payoff  in local currency amount format is converted properl y to credits upon 
transfer to the credit meter in a manner that does not mislead the player . 
d) The jackpot payoff shall update to the reset value and continue normal operations.  
 
NOTE:  A jackpot may be disabled or decommissioned concurrent with the winning of the jackpot if the game 
was configured to automatically disable or establish in its place an award  which does not increment.  
 
4.13.7  Swapping Jackpot Levels  
 
For jackpots offering multiple levels of awards, when a single winning combination may be 
evaluated as more than one of the available paytable combinations, unless otherwise explicitly 
defined in the game rules, the player shall always be paid the highest poss ible value based on all 
combinations to which the outcome may correlate (e.g., if “Jackpot A” is awarded for five aces on a 
payline and “Jackpot B” is awarded for four aces on a payline, and “Jackpot B” has a larger award 
than “Jackpot A”, the player shall be awarded the payoff for “Jackpot B” if the player obtains an

multiple players trigger at nearly the same time, such that the full amount of the displayed payoff 
can be awarded to winning player who triggered first. When t his is not possible or if it’s possible 
that multiple players trigger at the exact same time ( e.g., in a multi -player game), one of the 
following shall occur:  
 
a) The full amount of the displayed payoff shall be awarded to each winning player; or
